# DOT

Welcome to my dotfiles repo! This repository contains my personal macOS environment setup, including configurations for various tools and applications, scripts for automating the setup process, and more. The goal is to streamline the process of setting up a new macOS system or restoring my preferred environment on existing systems.

## Overview
This repository includes:

- Configuration files (dotfiles) for Zsh, Neovim, tmux, git, and other command-line tools.
- Scripts for automating the installation of Homebrew, Homebrew packages, and macOS applications.
- A dry run feature in scripts to preview changes without applying them.
